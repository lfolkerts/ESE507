1.File System Structure
src
 |-Generate.cpp				**source file of generator
 |-Makefile				**make script file of generator
 |-README				**this file
 |-gen					**generating program, if doesn't exist, compile it from sourece code
 |-Run.bash				**Script for synthesizing various outputs	
 |-Template				**template files used to generate modules and testbench
		|-mvm.template		**module template
		|-mvm_tb.template	**testbench template
		|runsynth.template	**synthesis template 
		|runsynth_test.template **synthesis template for Run.bash
		
2.Compilation
	a. Set src as current diretory.
	b. type "make" in command line.

3. Run.bash
	a. Create the directories src/tmp/, src/tmp/out and report/.
	b. Run the setup script: source ese507setup-csh
	c. Run in src: nohup bash Run.bash
		nohup is no-hangup, which will keep the script running even when ssh fails.
		The start of each simulation the parameters b,k,g,p,T,# are printed the the screen
			T is the clock period (misnamed frequency f in the script)
			# is the sate the script is in. 
		You can also redirect the output if you want. 
	d. Script will take ~42 hours to run
