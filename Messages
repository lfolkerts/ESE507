Lars' Comments about parts 1 and 2
	- Overall good job, very generic code that can be easily adapted in case something goes wrong
	- Variable names are good and easy to understand
		- Would it be possible to name the states directly as 06b'XXXXXX constants (i.e. Case STATE_LOOPA) instead of viewing the numbers and having the state names in comments? It was a little confusing and I had to draw it out on paper
	- I also did not like the incomplete listing of variables in the control block. I feel like it is easy to mess up what each signal is in the state (e.g. what was inc_y set to again). I think it would make the code more readable too, the tradeoff beeing the difficulty scrolling through many lines of code.
	- Control block needs a little more comments about what is going on
	- Your testbench is good. I implemented mine a little differently for project 1, where I wrote C code to generate sample inputs and solutions, then read the inputs and compared the outputs in the testbench. But your way is simpler and works fine - It is likely better since my way took a lot f time. 
	- Default parameters can be relative to each other. OUTPUT_SIZE = 2*INPUT_SIZE

++ Modified default parameter in part 2 from 3 to 4. It was specified in the testbench, but professor's testbench will likely use the default parameters
